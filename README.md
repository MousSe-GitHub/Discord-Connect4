# Discord-Connect4
Play Connect 4 with other people on discord ! Simply enter the command §play @player1 @player2 to start a game of Connect 4 and then use the reactions to play.

No need to worry about reactions slowly adding, games are played on 1 message to prevent channels from being filled with connect 4 games and let you play multiple games at once in one channel without interfering with others.

You can also do §play @player1 @player2 hard to activate hard mode.
